    <h1>Why I Switched to IPLogger</h1>
    <p class="lead">After trying like 6 different IP trackers, here's why I stuck with this one</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-5">
  
  <p class="lead mb-5">I'm not trying to sell you on IPLogger. Use whatever works for you. But after trying Grabify, IP-Tracker.org, WhatsTheirIP, and a few others, IPLogger is what I ended up sticking with. Here's why.</p>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h4>1. No Account Bullshit</h4>
    <p>This is the big one for me. I hate creating accounts for simple tools.</p>
    <p>With IPLogger: Go to site → Create link → Done. That's it.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Compare that to tools that make you: Enter email → Verify email → Create password → Confirm you're not a robot → THEN use the tool. Way too much hassle for something I might only use once.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h4>2. Links Don't Expire</h4>
    <p>Here's what happened with Grabify: I sent someone a link. They didn't click it for like 6 weeks. By then? Link expired. Had to send a new one, which looked suspicious.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">IPLogger links work forever. Send it today, they click it next month, still works. Way less awkward.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h4>3. Less Annoying Ads</h4>
    <p>Look, I get it - free tools need to make money somehow. Ads are fine.</p>
    <p>But Grabify has ads EVERYWHERE. Pop-ups, banners, auto-play videos. Got really old really fast.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">IPLogger has some ads too, but they're not in your face. I barely notice them.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h4>4. Email Tracking Included</h4>
    <p>Sometimes I need to track emails instead of links. IPLogger has that built in.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">With Grabify, you'd need a completely separate tool. With IPLogger, it's right there in the same place.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h4>5. Actually Free</h4>
    <p>Not "free tier with limitations." Not "7-day free trial." Just... free.</p>
    <p>I've been using it for over a year. Never paid a cent. Never been asked to pay. Never hit a limit that required upgrading.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Some tools say they're free but then you realize the free version is basically useless. IPLogger's free version IS the version. There's only one version.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What I Don't Love About It</h2>
  
  <p>To be fair, nothing's perfect:</p>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h5>Limited Custom Domains</h5>
    <p>Grabify has like 20 different domain options (bmwforum.co, fortnight.monster, etc.). IPLogger has fewer options.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">For me personally? Doesn't matter. The default domain works fine. But if you really need specific custom domains, Grabify wins here.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="reason-box">
    <h5>Basic Interface</h5>
    <p>It's not the prettiest website. It's functional but basic.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Again, doesn't bother me. I'm here to get someone's IP, not admire web design. But some people care about that stuff.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Who Should Use IPLogger?</h2>
  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="card mb-3 border-success">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="text-success">Good fit if you:</h5>
          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li>Hate creating accounts</li>
            <li>Want something simple</li>
            <li>Need links that last</li>
            <li>Don't care about fancy features</li>
            <li>Might need email tracking too</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-6">

          <h5 class="text-warning">Maybe skip if you:</h5>
          <ul class="mb-0">
            <li>Really need specific custom domains</li>
            <li>Want advanced analytics dashboards</li>
            <li>Need API integration for business</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2 mb-0 small">(Though honestly, if you need that stuff, you're probably not the target user for free tools anyway)</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
  
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>IPLogger does one thing: tracks IPs. It does it well, it does it for free, and it doesn't make you jump through hoops to use it.</p>
      
      <p>There are fancier tools out there with more features. There are tools with prettier interfaces. But for just tracking someone's IP address without hassle? This works.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-0">I switched to IPLogger about a year ago and haven't felt the need to switch to anything else. That's probably the best endorsement I can give.</p>
