                    <p class="lead">A friend sends you a link, or you see an interesting post online, but the link looks short and unfamiliar. You might wonder: could this be a virus? Or is it tracking my information?</p>
                    <p>This is a valid concern. Today, let's learn how to identify these "suspicious" links to protect your online safety.</p>

                        <h3>What Are Tracking Links (or Short URLs)?</h3>
                        <p>You've definitely seen links like <code>bit.ly/xxxx</code>, <code>t.co/xxxx</code>, or other very short web addresses. These are commonly known as "short URLs."</p>
                        <p>Their purpose is to turn a long, complicated URL into a short, easy-to-share one. For example, a very long Amazon product URL can be shortened into a tiny link, making it convenient to share on Twitter or in a text message.</p>
                        <p><strong>Most short links are harmless.</strong> Their main purpose is convenience and tracking click counts (like we discussed in a previous article). The problem is, you can't tell where a short link will take you just by looking at it. This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>How to Spot a Short Link?</h3>
                        <p>This is easy—it's all about the domain name. A normal, full link usually tells you which website it belongs to at a glance, for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGRJDFY</code> (Amazon)</li>
                            <li><code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcde</code> (YouTube)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A short link or tracking link, however, will typically use a domain from a URL shortening service, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>bit.ly/...</code></li>
                            <li><code>t.co/...</code> (Used by Twitter)</li>
                            <li><code>goo.gl/...</code> (Discontinued, but you might still see old ones)</li>
                            <li>And any other short, unfamiliar domain name.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h4><span class="tip-icon">💡</span> The Key Trick: Preview the Link Before Clicking!</h4>
                        <p>If you are unsure about a link's safety, <strong>never click it directly!</strong> Instead, use a "link expander" or "link preview" tool to safely see its true destination.</p>
                        <p>These tools act as a middleman. They will "visit" the short link for you and report back what the final, full-length URL is, all without exposing your own computer or phone to any risk.</p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>How to Use a Link Preview Tool</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Copy the Short Link:</strong> When you see a suspicious link, long-press it (on mobile) or right-click it (on a computer) and select "Copy Link Address." <strong>Be careful to copy, not open!</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Open a Preview Website:</strong> In your browser, open a link preview tool. You can search for "link checker" or "URL expander." Many free tools are available, such as the <a href="https://iplogger.icu/link-checker/" target="_blank">Link Checker from iplogger.icu</a>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paste and Check:</strong> Paste the short link you copied into the input box on the tool's website and click the "Check" or "Preview" button.</li>
                            <li><strong>Review the Result:</strong> The tool will display the original, full-length URL that the short link points to. Now you can make an informed decision:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the original URL is from a website you know and trust (like YouTube, Amazon, a major news site, etc.), it's likely safe.</li>
                                    <li>If the original URL looks strange, is from a domain you don't recognize, or contains suspicious words, it's best to avoid it.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                        <h4>Safe Browsing Summary</h4>
                        <p>Making a habit of "check before you click" is the first step to protecting yourself online. Short links are neutral tools, but we must be cautious of those from unknown sources.</p>
                        <p>To recap: <strong>Copy the link -> Use a tool to check it -> Click only if it's safe.</strong> This simple three-step process can help you avoid the vast majority of risks from malicious links.</p>
