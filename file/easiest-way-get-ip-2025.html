  <p class="lead">Look, I've seen all those tutorials with terminal commands and network monitoring. That's not easy - that's for tech people. Here's what actually works for regular folks.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">The Method (Takes 2 Minutes)</h2>
    
    <div class="step">
      <h4>Step 1: Go to an IP tracker website</h4>
      <p>Use <a href="/">this free one</a>. No sign up needed, just open it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
      <h4>Step 2: Type in any URL</h4>
      <p>Literally any website. YouTube, Instagram, whatever. Type "youtube.com" if you can't think of anything.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
      <h4>Step 3: Click "Create Link"</h4>
      <p>It'll give you a special tracking link. Copy it.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
      <h4>Step 4: Send them the link</h4>
      <p>Text it, email it, Discord it, whatever. Say something like "check this out" or "is this link working for you?"</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step">
      <h4>Step 5: Wait for them to click</h4>
      <p>When they do, go back to your results page. You'll see their IP address and location.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="mt-4 text-center"><strong>That's it. Seriously.</strong></p>

          <h5>Compared to Other Methods:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Command line:</strong> Requires knowing what commands to type. This? Just click buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>Email headers:</strong> Confusing to read. This shows location in plain English.</li>
            <li><strong>Network tools:</strong> Need to be on same network. This works remotely.</li>
            <li><strong>Social engineering:</strong> Requires skill. This just requires sending a link.</li>

          <h5>Why It Works:</h5>
          <p>When someone clicks ANY link on the internet, the website they're visiting can see their IP. That's just how the internet works.</p>
          <p>This tool creates a website (the tracking link) that records the IP before sending them to wherever you want them to go.</p>

        <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#q1">
          Is this the fastest way?

      </h2>
      <div id="q1" class="accordion-collapse collapse show">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          Yep. Unless you're literally sitting next to them and can look at their phone settings, this is the fastest remote method. Takes maybe 2 minutes total.
        </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#q2">
          Do I need to know anything about computers?

      </h2>
      <div id="q2" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          No. If you can copy and paste a link, you can do this. That's the whole point - it's made for non-tech people.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#q3">
          Will they know what I did?
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="q3" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          Probably not, unless they're suspicious and check the URL carefully before clicking. The link redirects them to a real website, so it looks normal.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <h2 class="accordion-header">
        <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#q4">
          What if they don't click the link?
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="q4" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          Then you don't get their IP. That's why you need to make the link relevant and interesting. "Click this random link" won't work. "Look at this funny video" might.

      </div>
    </div>

  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Alternatives (If This Doesn't Work)</h2>
  
  <p>Sometimes the link method doesn't work. Maybe they're not clicking links, maybe they're too suspicious. Here are backup plans:</p>
  
  <div class="card mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5>Email Method</h5>
      <p>Send an email with a tracking pixel. Works even if they don't click anything - just opening the email is enough.</p>

  <div class="card mb-3">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5>Ask Them to Help Test Something</h5>
      <p>"Hey can you check if this website loads for you?" People are usually willing to help, and it gives you a legit reason to send a link.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p class="mb-0">This method is easy, but remember - it only works if they click. So make it count. Don't send suspicious links. Make it natural, relevant, and timely.</p>
