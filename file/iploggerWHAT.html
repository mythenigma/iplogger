</div>
IPLogger is a tool that allows you to track and analyze the traffic through your links, visitors on your online store, blog or website. With IPLogger, you can find out the IP address, location, device, browser and other information of your visitors. You can also check URL for hidden redirects and safety reasons.

IPLogger works by creating a short link that contains a tracking code. When someone clicks on your short link, IPLogger will collect and store their data on a dashboard that you can access anytime. You can also create other types of loggers, such as an invisible pixel, a location tracker or a mobile phone tracker.
