    <h1>Is IPLogger Safe to Use?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Let me give you a straight answer</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="container my-5">
  
  <p class="lead mb-5">People ask this a lot. The answer isn't just yes or no - it depends what you mean by "safe." Let me break it down.</p>
  
  <h2 class="mb-4">Is It Safe for YOU to Use?</h2>
  
  <div class="safety-card yes-box">
    <h4 class="text-success">Yes, It's Safe for Users</h4>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't need to give any personal information to use it</li>
      <li>No account = no data stored about you</li>
      <li>The links you create are private - only you have the results link</li>
      <li>Website doesn't install anything on your computer</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Using IPLogger won't put your device or privacy at risk.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Is It Legal?</h2>
  
  <div class="safety-card yes-box">
    <h4 class="text-success">Yes, It's Legal</h4>
    <p>Tracking IP addresses is completely legal. Think about it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every website you visit logs your IP (Google, Facebook, literally everyone)</li>
      <li>Companies use IP tracking for analytics all the time</li>
      <li>It's public information that's transmitted with every internet request</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>However:</strong> What you DO with the information could be illegal. For example:
    <ul>
      <li class="text-danger">Using it to stalk or harass someone = not okay</li>
      <li class="text-danger">Using it to dox someone = definitely illegal</li>
      <li class="text-success">Using it to verify someone's location = fine</li>
      <li class="text-success">Using it for link analytics = perfectly normal</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The tool is legal. Don't use it for illegal purposes.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Is It Safe for the Person Being Tracked?</h2>
  
  <div class="safety-card maybe-box">
    <h4 class="text-warning">Depends on Who's Tracking Them</h4>
    <p>From a technical standpoint:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They're not giving away any info they don't give to every website</li>
      <li>No malware or viruses involved</li>
      <li>Their device isn't being hacked</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>But:</strong> If someone's using it to stalk or harass them, then obviously that's not safe for them. That's a people problem though, not a technical one.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The tool itself isn't dangerous to them. How someone uses it could be.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Can You Get in Trouble for Using It?</h2>
  
  <div class="safety-card">
    <h4>Honest Answer</h4>
    <p>Depends entirely on what you do:</p>
    
    <div class="row mt-3">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h5 class="text-success">Won't Get You in Trouble:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Checking if someone's being honest with you</li>
          <li>Verifying a business partner's location</li>
          <li>Link analytics for your own website</li>
          <li>Seeing if your email was read</li>
          <li>Catching someone in a lie</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h5 class="text-danger">Could Get You in Trouble:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Stalking someone repeatedly</li>
          <li>Posting someone's IP publicly</li>
          <li>Using it to harass or threaten</li>
          <li>Swatting (calling police to their location)</li>
          <li>Any form of blackmail</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Privacy Concerns</h2>
  
  <div class="safety-card">
    <h4>What IPLogger Knows About You</h4>
    <p><strong>When you create a link:</strong> Nothing. No email, no name, no account.</p>
    
    <p><strong>When someone clicks:</strong> IPLogger sees their IP, but doesn't know who YOU are (the person who created the link) unless you tell it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data storage:</strong> The click data is stored so you can view results. Your results link is private - only someone with that specific link can see the data.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Advice:</strong> Don't share your results link with people you don't trust. That link has all the tracking data.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Compared to Other Trackers</h2>
  
  <p>IPLogger is pretty standard compared to similar tools like Grabify or WhatsTheirIP. They all work the same way - create a link, track clicks, show IP info.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Safety-wise:</strong> IPLogger doesn't require an account (which is actually better for privacy). Some alternatives make you sign up, which means they have your email and can connect it to your tracking activity.</p>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">The Real Answer</h2>
  
  <div class="alert alert-primary" style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
    <p><strong>Is IPLogger safe?</strong> Yes, technically. It won't harm your computer, it's legal to use, and your privacy is protected.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Should you use it?</strong> That's up to you and your situation. It's a tool. Like any tool, it can be used responsibly or irresponsibly.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Will you get in trouble?</strong> Not if you're using it for normal, non-creepy purposes. Don't harass people, don't stalk people, don't be a jerk with the information - and you'll be fine.</p>
