</div>
Invisible images are often used in emails for tracking purposes. When you receive an email that contains an invisible image, the image is actually embedded in the HTML code of the email and is set to be invisible.

SpyPig was a free email tracking service that allowed users to embed a small tracking image into an email message to track when and where the message was opened. However, the website seems to be no longer active as of May 2023. It is unclear whether the service has been permanently discontinued or if it will be available again in the future. There are other similar services available, such as Bananatag, Mailtrack, and Hubspot Sales, that offer email tracking features.
<hr class="divider my-4">
When you open the email, your email client automatically requests the image from the sender's server. This request includes information about your email address and the time you opened
 the email, which allows the sender to track when and how you interacted with the email.


This tracking technique is often used by email marketers to gather information about the effectiveness of their email campaigns. They can track how many people opened the email, how
 many clicked on a link in the email, and how long they spent reading the email.

While invisible images can be a useful tool for email marketers, some people consider them to be a privacy concern. If you're concerned about being tracked in this way, you can disable
 automatic image loading in your email client or use an email client that blocks tracking images by default.

<hr class="divider my-4">
the logic behind using an invisible image in an email is to track whether the email has been opened or not. When the email is opened, the email client requests the image from a remote server, and the server logs the request as an open event.


As for the programming language used to write such a program, there is no specific language that is required. It can be implemented using any server-side programming language such as
 PHP, Python, Java, Node.js, etc. The basic idea is to create a small image and embed it in the email using an HTML img tag with a source that points to a server that logs the request. When the image is loaded, the server logs the request, and the information
 can be processed later to track open rates and other metrics.

Grabify.icu also offers simple tracking tool that allowed you to embed an invisible tracking image in your email, and you would receive an email notification when the recipient opened the email.
