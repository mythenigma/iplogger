<div class="container my-5">
  
  <p class="lead mb-5">So you know how to use an IP tracker, but here are some things that'll help you get better results. These are mostly from my own experience and mistakes I've made.</p>
  
  <h2 class="mb-4">Making People Actually Click Your Link</h2>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>1. Context is Everything</h4>
    <p>Don't just send a random link. Give people a reason to click it.</p>
    <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "click this"</p>
    <p><strong>Better:</strong> "Found this article about that thing we were talking about"</p>
    <p><strong>Even better:</strong> Start a conversation first, then naturally share the link</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>2. Use the Right Destination URL</h4>
    <p>Pick a URL that makes sense for your context. If you're supposedly sharing a funny video, don't use a news article URL as your destination.</p>
    <p>Some good options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>YouTube videos (everyone clicks these)</li>
      <li>Imgur or Reddit links (also pretty normal)</li>
      <li>News articles if you're in that kind of conversation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>3. Timing Matters</h4>
    <p>Send links when people are actually online and likely to click. Not at 3 AM (unless you know they're night owls).</p>
    <p>Best times in my experience: lunch hours, evening after work, weekends during the day.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <h5><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-2"></i>Don't be too obvious</h5>
    <p>If someone rarely sends you links and suddenly sends one, that's suspicious. Build up to it naturally.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <h5><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-2"></i>Check if they use VPN</h5>
    <p>If the IP shows they're in a totally different country than where you know they are, they're probably using a VPN. In that case, you're seeing the VPN server's location, not their real one.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="warning-box">
    <h5><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle me-2"></i>Mobile data shows cell tower location</h5>
    <p>If they're on mobile data (not WiFi), the IP might show a different city - usually where their carrier's cell tower is. So don't freak out if it's slightly off.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Reading the Results</h2>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>What You Can Trust</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Country:</strong> Almost always accurate</li>
      <li><strong>City:</strong> Usually accurate (within 10-50 miles)</li>
      <li><strong>ISP:</strong> Always accurate (the network provider)</li>
      <li><strong>Device type:</strong> Very reliable</li>
      <li><strong>Browser:</strong> Accurate</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="tip-box">
    <h4>What Might Be Off</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Exact location:</strong> Don't expect street address - that's not possible with just IP</li>
      <li><strong>Timezone:</strong> Can be spoofed</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinates:</strong> These are approximate, not GPS</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Quick Tricks</h2>
  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>Check Multiple Times</h4>
        <p>Send the same person a link on different days. If the location changes, they might be traveling or using VPN inconsistently.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>Compare With What They Tell You</h4>
        <p>If someone says they're in New York but the IP shows Texas, you've got your answer. But remember - could be VPN, could be they're lying, could be they're traveling.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>Look at ISP Type</h4>
        <p>Home ISP vs. Mobile data vs. Corporate network can tell you where they are (home, out and about, or at work).</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4>Note the Time They Clicked</h4>
        <p>If someone claims to be in California but clicks at 3 AM California time while you're chatting in what would be their daytime... they're probably not in California.</p>

  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What NOT to Do</h2>
  
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <h5>Seriously, don't do these:</h5>
    <ul class="mb-0">
      <li>Don't harass people with the information</li>
      <li>Don't send tracking links to random people you don't know</li>
      <li>Don't assume you know someone's exact location - IP isn't GPS</li>
      <li>Don't confront someone immediately with the info - you'll just reveal you were tracking them</li>
      <li>Don't use super obvious tracking domains if the person is tech-savvy</li>
    </ul>
