  <p class="lead mb-5">Never used IPLogger before? No problem. I'll walk you through everything. By the end of this, you'll be able to track someone's IP like a pro. (Spoiler: it's easier than you think)</p>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h3>Step 0: What You Need</h3>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
      <li>A web browser (you're using one right now)</li>
      <li>A way to send links (text, email, Discord, whatever)</li>
      <li>That's literally it</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>What you DON'T need:</strong> Account, payment, technical skills, software installation</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Your First Tracking Link (Step by Step)</h2>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>1. Open IPLogger</h4>
    <p>Go to <a href="/">iplogger.icu</a> in your browser. You'll see a simple page with an input box.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Notice something? No login screen, no "create account" popup. Just the tool. That's the point.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>2. Enter a Website URL</h4>
    <p>In the input box, type any website URL. For your first time, just use "youtube.com" - can't go wrong with that.</p>
    
    <div class="pro-tip">
      <strong>Why do you need to enter a URL?</strong><br>
      Because when someone clicks your tracking link, they need to end up somewhere. The URL you enter is where they'll go after the IP is captured.
      <br><br>
      Think of it like: Click tracking link → IP gets recorded → Person gets sent to the URL you chose
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>3. Click "Create Tracking Link"</h4>
    <p>Hit the button. Wait like 2 seconds. Done.</p>
    <p>You'll get two things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tracking Link</strong> - Send this to the person you want to track</li>
      <li><strong>Results Link</strong> - Use this to see who clicked</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> Save both links! Screenshot them, bookmark them, email them to yourself - whatever. You'll need them later.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>4. Send the Tracking Link</h4>
    <p>Copy the tracking link and send it to whoever you want to track.</p>
    
    <div class="pro-tip">
      <strong>Beginner Mistake:</strong> Don't just send "click this link" out of nowhere. That's weird and suspicious.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Better approach:</strong> Give context. Examples:
      <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>"Hey, check out this video I found"</li>
        <li>"Is this link working for you?"</li>
        <li>"Look at this meme lol"</li>
      </ul>
      Make it natural. Pretend the link is actually something you're sharing, not a tracking tool.
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>5. Wait for Them to Click</h4>
    <p>This is the part where you can't do anything. You just wait.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">They might click right away, might click in an hour, might never click. If they don't click after a day or two, you can try sending another link with better context.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="beginner-box">
    <h4>6. Check Your Results</h4>
    <p>When they click, open your results link (the one you saved earlier). You'll see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Their IP address</li>
      <li>What city/country they're in</li>
      <li>What device they used (iPhone, Android, laptop, etc.)</li>
      <li>What time they clicked</li>
      <li>Their internet provider</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0">If multiple people click the same link, you'll see all of them listed separately.</p>

          Then you won't get their IP. The whole method requires them to click. That's why making the link seem legit and interesting is important. If someone's not clicking your links at all, either: 1) Your links seem suspicious, 2) They're not interested, or 3) They're just slow to respond.

      </h2>
      <div id="q2" class="accordion-collapse collapse">
        <div class="accordion-body">
          Yes. Either send them the same link again (it'll record each click) or create new links. Both work. If you want to track someone over time to see if their location changes, use the same link - that way all the data is in one place.

          Use something that makes sense for your conversation. If you're talking about music, use a YouTube link. If you're chatting about news, use a news site. The goal is to not make them suspicious. A link to a random website they've never heard of? Weird. A link to YouTube or Instagram? Normal.

          Usually gets the city right. So if they're in Chicago, it'll say Chicago. Won't give you their street address though - that's not possible with IP tracking. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying. Also, if they're using mobile data, it might show the cell tower's location which could be a few miles off.
