            <h2>Steps to Track an IP Address Using a Link</h2>
            <p>Here’s how to track someone’s IP address using a link, in just a few easy steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create a Trackable Link:</strong> The first thing you need to do is create a trackable link that logs the IP address of anyone who clicks on it.

                <li><strong>Monitor Clicks:</strong> Once the link is clicked, the tool automatically records the IP address of the user who clicked it. The details of the visitor are logged, including the geographical location, device type, and browser used.</li>
                <li><strong>Access the Data:</strong> After someone clicks on your link, you can log in to the tool’s dashboard to view the recorded data. You’ll be able to see the IP address, the time of the click, and additional insights such as the user’s device and location.</li>
            </ol>
